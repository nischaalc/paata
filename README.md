paata
=====

Paata is an color picker ([this](colorpicker.com) sort of thing) that I am trying to build as a challenge to myself. 
Initially, it will provide basic functionality, such as: 

* Use sliders (from [Foundation](foundation.zurb.com)) to change RGB values.
* Copy the RGB or hex value of the generated color.

Later on, I will be adding support for:

* *rgba*, making **Paata** an ideal color picker for web developers.
* Options to generate *complementary* color schemes based on the user generated color.
