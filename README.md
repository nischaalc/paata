Paata!
=====

Paata is an color picker ([this](http://colorpicker.com) sort of thing) that I built as a challenge to myself. 
Right now it provides basic functionality, such as: 

* Use sliders (from [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com)) to change RGB values.
* Copy the RGB or hex value of the generated color.
* Generates a color that complements your generated color

Later on, I will be adding support for:

* The ability to enter your own colors in hex or RGB.

Paata is the [Sinhalese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_language) word for color - just in case you were wondering.
